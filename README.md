# Seismic_Story_Map

GEOG-458: An interactive story map of seismic hazards in King County highlighting recent Earthquakes in the area.

# Content inventory:
	Our main topic will consist of mapping Seismic Hazard areas in King County and the recent seismic activity from the past 30 days in those areas. Our target audience will mainly consist of King County residents who live in the areas we will be mapping as well as all biological life living in those areas. We will highlight hazard zones and provide interactive features that will allow users to view the most recent earthquake activities in the selected areas. Patterns and commonly seen geographic features within our data will also be included as part of our overall analysis to help draw conclusions to our findings. 

# Project Type (Interactive web map, dashboard, storymap, etc.):
	Our project and data findings will be represented in a story map format, allowing users to view the various areas in King County that have had seismic activities and recent earthquake recordings. By creating an interactive map we will be able to communicate our findings more visually and still allow for important information to be represented. Our main priority for this project will be to educate users on King County and the seismic risks in the area.

# Data Acquisition (Metadata including data source, data format):
	The main data sources we will be drawing data and conclusions from come from the King County GIS Center and the United States Geological Survey.  The first source of metadata was sourced by the King County Sensitive Areas Ordinance and will come in the format of a GeoJSON file and is the source that will help us locate areas in King County with seismic hazards. The second source of metadata was sourced by the Earthquakes Hazard Program and comes in the format of GeoJSON as well to help us use a density function to allow users to view the most recent earthquake activity in the selected area.

# Storyline on your project:
	The interactive story map begins with an overview of Seismic Hazards in King County highlighting the areas prone to seismic activity. Users are introduced to facts and history of seismic activity in King County in this chapter. As users begin scrolling through, we zoom into the different major hazard areas presenting recent Earthquakes recorded in those areas. Some of these areas include northeast King County, North Bend, Maple Valley, and areas around Sammamish. Selecting the Earthquake icons will allow the users to view more information about the magnitude of Earthquakes. The final part of the story map will present information on earthquake preparedness in King County. It will allow users to learn more about King County’s infrastructure for earthquake safety and be aware of the areas they’re living in.
